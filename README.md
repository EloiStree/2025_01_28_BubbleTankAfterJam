Following the Global Game Jam, Bubble Tank allows you to control a tank and fire bubbles.  
You need to work as a team to survive.  

You can play using human input or code.  

This game is designed for learning and group play, supporting 6 to 36+ players.  
It can handle up to 100 players in FPS mode and 256 players in UDP with max size.  
If we used only bytes instead of strings for broadcasting, we could potentially reach 1,400 players.
